# LagPauser

Lag pauser is a mod that can automatically pause the game upon detecting a lag spike (lag threshold is configurable). This is a remake of the original lag pauser (with permission) which you may have seen before. There are a few notable differences from that version. First of all, this one is on Game Banana! No more transfering a zip through back alley discord dms! There are also some more direct QOL changes. When the game pauses due to lag, the pause menu says "Lag Paused" and the retry button is disabled. Also there is a configurable cooldown and respawn cooldown. These disable the lag detection for a certain amount of time after pausing or after respawning.

If you wanna take a look at the code its public on [github](https://github.com/samgcode/LagPauser)
